# lib/blocs/ Directory

Contains BLoC (Business Logic Components) pattern implementations.

## Purpose

This directory holds:
- Business logic components
- Event and state definitions
- Bloc implementations
- Cubit implementations (simpler state management)

## BLoC Pattern Benefits

- Separates presentation from business logic
- Reactive programming with streams
- Predictable state management
- Easy to test and debug

## Structure

- `auth/` - Authentication BLoC
- `user/` - User management BLoC
- `product/` - Product-related BLoC

## File Organization

Each BLoC typically has:
- `*_bloc.dart` - Main BLoC implementation
- `*_event.dart` - Event definitions
- `*_state.dart` - State definitions

## Best Practices

- Use sealed classes for events and states
- Implement proper error handling
- Write comprehensive tests
- Use equatable for value comparison
