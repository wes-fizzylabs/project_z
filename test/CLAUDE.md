## Structure

- `unit/` - Unit tests for individual functions and classes
- `widget/` - Widget tests for UI components
- `integration/` - End-to-end integration tests

## Test Types

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions, methods, and classes
- Fast execution, isolated testing
- Mock external dependencies

### Widget Tests
- Test UI components and interactions
- Verify widget behavior and rendering
- Test user interactions and state changes

### Integration Tests
- Test complete user flows
- Test app behavior on real devices
- Verify API integrations and data flow

## Best Practices

- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high test coverage
- Write tests before implementing features (TDD)
